# Hawk-AI-CV-Project
A computer vision project implementing a simplified, 2D version of the Hawk-Eye system. This repository focuses on detecting IN/OUT ball verdicts from fixed-camera tennis footage using projective geometry.


About the files in the main directory:

-"video"---> input video

-"OUTPUT_video" ---> output video after the ball tracking with YOLO

-"FINAL_JUDGE_video" ---> output video with the verdict IN/OUT

In the directory data/ball_trajectory_videos there are the output videos after using YOLO for training and understanding its functionalities. They were taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gastonarielfrancois/tenis-backview?select=video9.mp4
