A computer vision project implementing a simplified, 2D version of the Hawk-Eye system. This repository focuses on detecting IN/OUT ball verdicts from fixed-camera tennis footage using projective geometry.


About the files in the main directory:
-"video"---> input video

-"FINAL_JUDGE_video" ---> output video with the verdict IN/OUT
